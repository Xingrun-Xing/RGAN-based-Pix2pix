# RGAN-based-Pix2pix

This is the code of my conference paper "Image-to-Image Translation using a Relativistic Generative Adversarial Network " in the 11th International Conference of Digital Image Processing (ICDIP 2019). This code refers to the basic [pix2pix-pytorch](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix) code heavily and thinks for the sharing.<br><br>

We use a relativistic generative adversarial network to implement image domain transformation tasks, for example label-to-photo and photo-to-map.<br>

## Label-to-photo task on the Cityscapes dataset
